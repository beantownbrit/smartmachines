This app guides those who believe they may have been retaliated against due to taking paid leave as allowed under the [Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave Act](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter175M). While passed in 2018, the substance of the act - including protections for employees against retaliatory actions by their employer - went into effect on January 1, 2021. This app uses Chapter 175M Sections 9(c) and (d) to form the framework of the app. I also included language found in the [poster](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/notice-and-acknowledgement-for-the-paid-family-and-medical-leave-pfml-law-for-executive-department-employees) covered employers are legally required to post conspicuously in the workplace.
